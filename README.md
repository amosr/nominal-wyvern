# nominal-wyvern

An implementation of the Nominal Wyvern type system written in Haskell

([wyvernlang.github.io](http://wyvernlang.github.io/))

## TODO
* Check that nested type declarations work
* Related, TypeDecls should add nested TypeDecls to context (both binding and typechecking problem)
* Check for valid shape usage (probably at the same time, throw errors as needed)
* Look into the extra edges rules
* Later: REPL for typing/subtyping queries
